            ascii_symbols (Sequence[str]): ASCII string symbols for the quantum operator.
                These are used when printing a diagram of circuits.
                Length must be the same as `qubit_count`, and index ordering is expected
                to correlate with target ordering on the instruction.
                For instance, if CNOT instruction has the control qubit on the first index and
                target qubit on the second index. Then ASCII symbols would have ["C", "X"] to
                correlate a symbol with that index.
