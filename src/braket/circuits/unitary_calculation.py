    Returns the unitary matrix representation for all the `instructions` on qubits `qubits`.

    Note:
        The performance of this method degrades with qubit count. It might be slow for
        `len(qubits)` > 10.

    Args:
        instructions (Iterable[Instruction]): The instructions for which the unitary matrix
            will be calculated.
        qubits (QubitSet): The actual qubits used by the instructions.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A numpy array with shape (2^qubit_count, 2^qubit_count) representing the
        `instructions` as a unitary matrix.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `instructions` is not composed only of `Gate` instances,
            i.e. a circuit with `Noise` operators will raise this error.
            Any `CompilerDirective` instructions will be ignored, as these should
            not affect the unitary representation of the circuit.
