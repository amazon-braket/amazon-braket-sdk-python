    Class `Gate` represents a quantum gate that operates on N qubits. Gates are considered the

    the metadata that defines what a gate is and what it does.

            qubit_count (int): Number of qubits this gate interacts with.
            ascii_symbols (Sequence[str]): ASCII string symbols for the gate. These are used when
                printing a diagram of circuits. Length must be the same as `qubit_count`, and
                index ordering is expected to correlate with target ordering on the instruction.
                For instance, if CNOT instruction has the control qubit on the first index and
                target qubit on the second index. Then ASCII symbols would have ["C", "X"] to
                correlate a symbol with that index.
