class BraketSimulator(ABC):
    """ An abstract simulator that locally runs a quantum task.

    The task can be either a circuit-based program or an annealing task,
    specified by the given IR.

    For users creating their own simulator: to register a simulator so the
    Braket SDK recognizes its name, the name and class must added as an
    entry point for "braket.simulators". This is done by adding an entry to
    entry_points in the simulator package's setup.py:

    >>> entry_points = {
    >>>     "braket.simulators": [
    >>>         "backend_name = <backend_class>"
    >>>     ]
    >>> }

    # TODO: Move this class to the local simulator repo and take a dependency on it
    # As such, this will not depend on any SDK classes.

    # TODO: Update to use new simulate() method
