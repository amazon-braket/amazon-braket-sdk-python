class DirectReservation(AbstractContextManager):
    """
    Context manager that modifies AwsQuantumTasks created within the context to use a reservation
    ARN for all tasks targeting the specified device. Note: this context manager only allows for
    one reservation at a time.

    Reservations are AWS account and device specific. Only the AWS account that created the
    reservation can use your reservation ARN. Additionally, the reservation ARN is only valid on the
    reserved device at the chosen start and end times.

    Args:
        device (Device | str | None): The Braket device for which you have a reservation ARN, or
            optionally the device ARN.
        reservation_arn (str | None): The Braket Direct reservation ARN to be applied to all
            quantum tasks run within the context.

    Examples:
        As a context manager
        >>> with DirectReservation(device_arn, reservation_arn="<my_reservation_arn>"):
        ...     task1 = device.run(circuit, shots)
        ...     task2 = device.run(circuit, shots)

        or start the reservation
        >>> DirectReservation(device_arn, reservation_arn="<my_reservation_arn>").start()
        ... task1 = device.run(circuit, shots)
        ... task2 = device.run(circuit, shots)
