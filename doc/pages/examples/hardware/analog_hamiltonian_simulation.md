This tutorial series provides a step-by-step walkthrough explaining analog Hamiltonian simulations (AHS) and how to run AHS programs on local simulators and Rydberg-based QPUs via Amazon Braket. AHS is a quantum computing paradigm different from gate-based computing. AHS uses a well-controlled quantum system and tunes its parameters to mimic the dynamics of another quantum system, the one we aim to study. In the gate-based quantum computation, the program is a quantum circuit consisting of a series of quantum gates, each of which acts only a small subset of qubits. In contrast, an AHS program is a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians that govern the quantum dynamics of all qubits; during AHS, the effect of the evolution under a Hamiltonian can be understood as a unitary acting simultaneously on all qubits.
