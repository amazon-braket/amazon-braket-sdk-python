    This tutorial illustrates how Amazon Braket integrates with Amazon EventBridge for event-based processing. In the tutorial, you will learn how to configure Amazon Braket and Amazon Eventbridge to receive text notification about task completions on your phone. Of course, EventBridge also allows you to build full, event-driven applications based on events emitted by Amazon Braket.
