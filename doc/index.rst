It is easy to get started with Amazon Braket. 

Getting started using an Amazon Braket notebook
================================================

You can use the AWS Console to enable Amazon Braket, 
then create an Amazon Braket notebook instance
and run your first circuit with the Amazon Braket Python SDK:

1. `Enable Amazon Braket<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-enable-overview.html>`_.
2. `Create an Amazon Braket notebook instance<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-create-notebook.html>`_.
3. `Run your first circuit using the Amazon Braket Python SDK<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-run-circuit.html>`_.

When you use an Amazon Braket notebook, the Amazon Braket SDK and plugins are
preloaded. 

Getting started in your environment
===================================

You can install the Amazon Braket Python SDK in your environment
after enabling Amazon Braket and configuring the AWS SDK for Python:

1. `Enable Amazon Braket<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-enable-overview.html>`_.
2. Configure the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) using the `Quickstart<https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html>`_.
3. `Run your first circuit using the Amazon Braket Python SDK<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-get-started-run-circuit.html>`_.
