    "Native gates are a set of carefully calibrated gates directly supported by the hardware. Behind the scenes, native gates themselves are implemented by analog control signals, or \"pulses\", applied to the state of the qubits. Composing a program directly with pulse operations is called \"pulse programming\", giving you even more control than native gates. For example, you can implement quantum operations directly with pulses in order to implement error suppression schemes such as dynamical decoupling, or error mitigation methods such as zero noise extrapolation. You can also improve the elementary operations by experimenting with novel custom gate implementations.\n",

Basic pulse operations include setting the frequency and phase of a frame, playing a waveform, applying a delay, and capturing the output of a frame.

    "In the `idle` program above, we intentionally add a delay instruction to the program to make the qubit idle. In general, qubit idling is inevitable. For instance, if an instruction applies to multiple qubits, it will execute only when all of its qubits are available. Some qubits may idle while the other qubits are still undergoing other instructions. During this idling time, the qubits are subject to decoherence, resulting in low program fidelity. Dynamical decoupling is a technique to suppress such errors. It includes alternating pairs of X and Y \"$\\pi$ pulse\", a rotation around the Bloch sphere axis with an angle $\\pi$, on the qubits while they idle. These pulses together are equivalent to an identity gate, but alternating \"$\\pi$ pulses\" cause some of the decoherence to effectively cancel out. To learn more about dynamical decoupling, [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/suppressing-errors-with-dynamical-decoupling-using-pulse-control-on-amazon-braket/) has a detailed explanations and visualization of dynamical decoupling sequences."
