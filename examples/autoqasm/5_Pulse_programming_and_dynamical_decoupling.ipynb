    "Native gates is a set of carefully calibrated gates directly supported by the hardware. Behind the scene, native gates themselves are implemented by analog control signals, or \"pulses\", applying on the state of the qubits. Composing a program directly with pulse operations is called \"pulse programming\", giving you even more control than native gates. For example, you can quantum operations directly in pulses in order to implement error suppression schemes such as dynamical decoupling, or error mitigation methods such zero noise extrapolation. You can also improve the elementary operation by experimenting novel custom gate implementations.\n",

    "In the `idle` program above, we intentionally add a delay instruction to the program. In more practical programs, qubit idling is inevitable. It often happens when a gate or pulse instruction applies on multiple qubits, but some of the qubit are still under other instructions. The rest of the qubits are idling and waiting for all qubits to be ready. During this idling time, the qubits are subjected to decoherence, resulting in low program fidelity. Dynamical decoupling is a technique to suppress such errors. It includes alternating pairs of X and Y \"$\\pi$ pulse\", a rotation around the Bloch sphere axis with an angle $\\pi$, applying on the qubits during the idling time. These pulses together are equivalent to an identity gate, but alternating \"$\\pi$ pulses\" make some of the decoherence effectively cancel each other out. To learn more about dynamical decoupling, [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/suppressing-errors-with-dynamical-decoupling-using-pulse-control-on-amazon-braket/) has a detailed explanations and visualization of dynamical decoupling sequences."

    "This example shows you how to use pulse programming to create a program. Same as a gate-based circuit, a pulse program is compose in a function decorated by `@aq.main`. With AutoQASM, you can easily compose a pulse program because the pulse instructions are automatically added to `cal` blocks in OpenQASM script. There is no need to define additional scope that separates gate and pulse instructions in AutoQASM.  "
