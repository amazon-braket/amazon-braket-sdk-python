    "# Magic state distillation and gate teleportation\n",
    "In fault tolerant quantum computing, Clifford gates have many desirable properties in stabilizer codes. For example, they can be implemented transversally and their noise is contained locally [1]. Therefore, there is a strong preference to include Clifford gates in a logical gateset. However, Clifford gates alone do not form a universal gateset. At least one non-Clifford gate is needed to perform universal quantum computing. Magic states are certain quantum states that enable universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with Clifford gates and preserve the desirable properties of the Clifford gates. With magic states, we can effectively apply non-Clifford gates using only Clifford gates, forming a universal gateset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we first demonstrate how to implement a non-Clifford gate with only Clifford gates and magic states. This procedure is known as \\\"gate teleportation\\\". Because the preparation of the magic state in this first demonstration is not fault-tolerant (i.e., it is not prepared with an error correction code), it is subject to noise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the second demonstration, we introduce a procedure to create logical magic states based on the 5-qubit error correction code [2], called magic state distillation [1]. This procedure is based on post-selection, so the preparation of magic states has a finite probability of failing under this protocol.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, we introduce a \\\"repeat until success\\\" protocol [3] that guarantees every execution prepares a magic state successfully. For all the protocols in this notebook, we use AutoQASM to program these procedures, demonstrating AutoQASM's ability to express the classical control flow needed for magic state distillation and how AutoQASM enables early fault-tolerant quantum computing experiments."

    "## Apply non-Clifford gates with magic states\n",
    "To form a universal gateset, at least one non-Clifford gate is needed in addition to Clifford gates. This additional gate is commonly chosen to be $RZ(\\pi/4)$ or $RZ(\\pi/6)$ gate. These non-Clifford gates are not possible to implement transversally with stabilizer code. Including these non-Clifford gates would lose the desirable properties of Clifford gates. Here is where magic states come to the rescue. In this section, let's learn how to apply a $RZ(\\pi/6)$ gate with only Clifford gates and a magic state [1], a procedure known as gate teleportation. Similar to [state teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation), gate teleportation uses forward feedback to form dynamic circuits, but with the intention of applying a quantum gate instead of teleporting a quantum state. For simplicity, we first focus on demonstrating the algorithm of gate teleportation with a physical circuit, i.e., without encoding to an error correction code. The same algorithm can also apply to logical circuits, by replacing the Clifford gates and the magic state with the logical version. After this section, we will introduce how to create a logical magic state."
